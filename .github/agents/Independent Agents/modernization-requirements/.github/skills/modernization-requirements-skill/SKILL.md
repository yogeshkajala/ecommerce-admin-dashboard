# Modernization Requirements Skill

## Purpose
Provides domain-specific knowledge and step-by-step procedures for Modernization Requirements operations.

## When to Use
- When performing migration tasks that require specialized knowledge
- When structured output and validated results are needed
- When domain best practices and industry standards must be applied

## Capabilities
- Assess source systems for migration readiness and complexity scoring
- Design migration strategies (rehost, replatform, refactor, rebuild, replace)
- Plan cutover sequences with rollback checkpoints and data validation gates
- Map legacy dependencies and integration points requiring transformation
- Validate data integrity pre- and post-migration with reconciliation checks
- Estimate migration effort, risk, and timeline with confidence intervals
- Execute incremental migration waves with parallel-run verification
- Generate migration runbooks with detailed step-by-step procedures

## Procedure
1. Receive migration request -- identify source systems, target platform, and business constraints
2. Assess source system complexity -- inventory dependencies, integrations, and data volumes
3. Classify workloads using migration strategy framework (6Rs: rehost through retire)
4. Design migration plan with waves, dependencies, cutover sequences, and rollback checkpoints
5. Execute pre-migration validation -- data integrity baselines, performance benchmarks, connectivity tests
6. Perform migration execution according to plan -- monitor progress and validate each checkpoint
7. Run post-migration validation -- data reconciliation, functional verification, performance comparison
8. Generate migration report with status, issues, data validation results, and lessons learned

## Output Format
Return structured results:
- **Migration Status**: overall progress, current wave, completed/remaining workloads
- **Complexity Score**: per-workload complexity rating with contributing factors
- **Data Validation**: record counts, checksum verification, reconciliation results
- **Risk Register**: identified risks, probability, impact, mitigation status
- **Timeline**: planned vs actual milestones with variance analysis

## Industry Standards
| Standard | Relevance |
|----------|-----------|
| **AWS 6Rs Framework** | Migration strategies -- Rehost, Replatform, Refactor, Repurchase, Retire, Retain |
| **TOGAF Migration Planning** | Enterprise-level migration planning and transition architectures |
| **CAB/ITIL Change Mgmt** | Change approval and risk assessment for migration cutover events |

## Anti-Hallucination Rules
- NEVER fabricate data, metrics, or measurements -- use only verified sources
- ALWAYS cite the source file, document, or system for any referenced data
- NEVER assume system state without querying or verifying current conditions
- ALWAYS validate inputs against expected formats before processing
- NEVER skip required validation or verification steps in procedures
- NEVER make recommendations without supporting evidence or analysis
- ALWAYS verify assumptions against actual system or codebase state
